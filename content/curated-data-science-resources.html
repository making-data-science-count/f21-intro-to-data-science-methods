<div id="what-this-resource-is-4" class="section level3">
<h3>What this resource is</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This resource provides simple and transferable instructions/tips to making map formats using the package ggmap.
ggmap has the capability of importing base maps from Google and or the ability to incorporate imported coordinate data. This resource also uses functions from ggplot2 to incorporate data layers (i.e., census data).
### Who will find this resource helpful</p></li>
<li><p>This resource is for someone who only has basic R skills/knowledge. This package uses spatial data (i.e., longitude and latitude coordinates) to build maps. The ggplot2 and ggmap packages allows users to make a variety of maps, from simple to complex.</p></li>

<div id="advice-on-how-to-use-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Advice on how to use</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though my project did not require all aspects of this specific mapping resource, I found it most helpful to walk through the entire document and complete each step. This allowed me to familiarize myself with the packages and built my confidence for when it came time to execute my actual project. Extra practice is always useful. Here is additional links that was also helpful for creating maps in R: <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html;http://www.nickeubank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RGIS3_MakingMaps_part1_mappingVectorData.html" class="uri">https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html;http://www.nickeubank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RGIS3_MakingMaps_part1_mappingVectorData.html</a>.</li>
